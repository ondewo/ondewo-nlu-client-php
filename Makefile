# ondewo-nlu-client-php - Makefile
#
# The ONDEWO NLU (Natural Language Understanding) gRPC client for PHP. The transport surface is
# generated from the .proto definitions of ondewo-nlu-api by the ondewo-proto-compiler's
# `ondewo-php-proto-compiler` image into src/ (committed - see .gitignore), the only hand-written
# code is the bearer-token auth surface in auth/, and the repository root IS the composer package
# that gets published.
#
# Quick start:
#   make help                    # list every documented target
#   make makefile_chapters       # list the section headers below
#   make update_submodules       # fetch ondewo-nlu-api + ondewo-proto-compiler
#   make build                   # submodules -> compiler image -> stubs -> version bump
#   make test                    # manifest validation + php -l + stub inventory + PHPUnit
#   make test_via_docker         # the same in the utils image (Dockerfile.utils) - no host php/composer
#   make ci                      # the checks of ci.yml's php job (no submodules, installs not included)
#   make ondewo_release          # the WHOLE release, locally - CI never builds, publishes or releases
#
# Host requirements: `make build`, `make test_via_docker` and `make ondewo_release` need only make,
# git, docker, perl and curl - php, composer and gh run in the utils image. The un-suffixed targets
# (test, packagist_dry_run, publish, push_to_gh, validate_release_credentials) are what runs INSIDE
# that image; ci.yml runs only the test/lint ones natively.
#
# Versioning: ONDEWO_NLU_VERSION (below) is the single source of truth and MUST
# match the ONDEWO NLU API in major and minor version. `make update_composer_version`
# propagates it into composer.json - never edit that field by hand.
#
# Overriding variables: pass on the command line, e.g. `make build PROTO_COMPILER_IMAGE=...`.
# Credentials (GITHUB_GH_TOKEN, PACKAGIST_USERNAME, PACKAGIST_API_TOKEN) live ONLY in the
# ondewo-devops-accounts repository: `make ondewo_release` clones it and hands them to `make release`
# at runtime. They are never committed here and never stored in GitHub.
# =====================================================================================

# ---------------- BEFORE RELEASE ----------------
# 1 - Update Version Number and API pin (ONDEWO_NLU_VERSION, ONDEWO_NLU_API_GIT_BRANCH below)
# 2 - Update RELEASE.md
# (ondewo-nlu-api's `make release_all_clients` does both and then runs `make ondewo_release`)
# -------------- Release Process Steps (`make ondewo_release`, all local) --------------
# 1 - Write the version into composer.json and README.md, check branch and tag are still free (spc)
# 2 - Get Credentials from devops-accounts repo
# 3 - Check the credentials are set, and that the GitHub token can push to this repository
# 4 - Build, then test and Packagist dry run in the utils image
# 5 - Commit, push, create Release Branch and Release Tag and push them
# 6 - Packagist Release (`make publish`: there is no upload step - Packagist serves the git tag,
#     so the release only validates the package and pings the update API to have it crawled)
# 7 - GitHub Release, LAST - so an existing GitHub release marks a complete release

#	-it belongs only on the `--entrypoint /bin/bash` debug command documented in the README.
# NOTE: input volume AND output volume are both the repository root. The image copies the input
#	volume into an internal temp directory and compiles there, so the mounted input is never
#	mutated; it then writes composer.json, composer.lock, src/ and vendor/ back here, wiping its
#	own src/ and vendor/ first so a renamed or deleted proto leaves no orphaned stub behind.
#	The repository root has to be the input volume because the image reads BOTH the proto root
#	(${ONDEWO_NLU_API_DIR}) and this package's composer.json from there - it merges
#	that manifest with its own defaults instead of overwriting it.
# NOTE: hand-written PHP belongs in auth/ at the repository root, NEVER in src/. src/ is
#	compiler-owned and wiped on every run; composer.json's autoload.psr-4 maps auth/.
# NOTE: the container runs as the invoking user (--user), so src/, vendor/ and composer.* come out
#	owned by you and no sudo chown is needed afterwards. The image was built to run as root, so its
#	root-owned paths are redirected; the first and the last are load-bearing (verified against compiler
#	5.15.1, which fails without either), HOME and COMPOSER_HOME only keep composer off root-owned homes:
#	TEMP_SRC_DIRECTORY   its staging directory, by default /image-data/src ("Permission denied");
#	COMPOSER_HOME        by default /image-data/composer-home;
#	COMPOSER_CACHE_READ_ONLY=1  the offline resolution reads the root-owned, pre-warmed
#	                     /image-data/composer-cache; without the flag composer finds that cache
#	                     unwritable, "proceeds without cache" and fails on the disabled network.

#     Packagist derives the version from the TAG, but the fleet keeps the field so the version is
#     greppable in the tree; `check_version_agreement` below is what keeps the two from drifting.
#   * the two exact version constraints     - google/protobuf and grpc/grpc MUST be pinned to the
#     exact versions the compiler image ships (README rule 2): the image resolves the merged
#     manifest with the network OFF, from a cache warmed at image-build time, so a range that
#     resolves to anything else takes `make generate_ondewo_protos` down.

# fails on any warning that is NOT one of those three - a newly introduced warning is a real
# regression and would otherwise drown in `composer validate`'s output.
# --no-check-lock: composer.lock is deliberately NOT committed here (see .gitignore - this is a

# after `make install_dependencies` has written one, and would otherwise fail on a purely local

#     `grep -Fx` is a fixed-string, whole-line match: only the tag itself.
#   * Test 3 compared the composer.json LINE against the empty string, so it passed for ANY
